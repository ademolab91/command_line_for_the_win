This folder contains proof of tasks completed in the
cmd challenge game.

In this folder are pictures of 27 completed tasks.

It contains pictures of the first 9 tasks, followed
by the next 9 tasks and the next 9 after it.

The challenge required the use of different terminal
commands such as bc, grep, ls, cat, tail, pwd etc to
complete tasks

Although, it wasn't easy but what really matters is the
knowledge, and I am glad I learned alot through this challenge
